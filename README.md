Take control of your emotional eating

This is a work-in-progress flutter app for logging emotional state while eating food.

Before eating, the user will log the following:
- emotional states (happy, calm, stressed, sad etc)
- how healthy the user thinks the food is for the user right now.
- location (automatically)
- time (automatically)

The user will be asked a question or shown visualizations based on previously collected data. Examples:
- How much less healthier the food is when the user is emotionally instable.
- How eating times correlates with healthiness.
- how location correlates with healthiness.
- Emotions on different weekdays (doesn't have to be all about food).
